# horseracing
# Data Science Project

# This is my data science and machine learning project on predicting horse racing!
# I predict which horse will win in any given race using binary classification models and which horse will place (top 3 in a race)
# In this project I demonstrate EDA(removing outliers, scaling), visualization, machine learning models(logistic regressing, bagging, random forest)
